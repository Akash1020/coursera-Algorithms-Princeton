*Social network connectivity:*  
     Given a social network containing nn members and a log file containing mm timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected  
     (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp  
     and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be `mlogn` or better and use  
     extra space proportional to `n` 

*Solution:*    
     **Design an union-find algorithm, that performs union of two friends at a time. In the beginning all the n members are individual components.  
     As we start doing union operation recursively in the order of the input of friendship being formed - We check the number of connected components after every single union task. when the total number of connected components becomes equal to 1 that is when the algorithmic operation stops.  
     Total number of connected components decreases with each iteration, with each union task.  
     Total time that takes till total number of components is equal to 1 is mlogn**
     



*Union-find with specific canonical element:*    
     Add a method `find()` to the union-find data type so that `find(i)` returns the largest element in the connected component containing `i`. The operations, `union()`, `connected()` and `find()` should all take logarithmic time or better.  
     For example, if one of the connected components is `{1,2,6,9}`, then the `find()` method should return 9  
     for each of the four elements in the connected components.  
     
     
     
*Successor with delete:*  
     Given a set of `n` integers `S = {0,1,...,nâˆ’1}` and a sequence of requests of the following form:  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;Remove `x` from S  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;Find the successor of `x`: the smallest `y` in `S` such that `y>=x`  
     design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.
